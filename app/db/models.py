# app/db/models.py
# This file might define other database models not related to UserProfileTable,
# or it might now be empty if UserProfileTable was its only content.

# Example: If you have other models, they would remain here.
# from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
# from app.db.session import Base
#
# class AnotherModel(Base):
#     __tablename__ = "another_model"
#     id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
#     name = Column(String)

# If UserProfileTable was the only model here, this file might now be empty
# or you could remove it if it's no longer needed and adjust imports accordingly.
# For now, let's assume it might have other models or can be left as is if empty.
pass  # Placeholder if no other models are in this specific file
