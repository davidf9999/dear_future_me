#     # The above diff for the test function itself is what I'll apply.
#     # The critical part is the `patch_asyncio_run_for_click_runner` fixture.
#     # If that fixture (with patches for asyncio.run, click.core.asyncio.run, click.utils.asyncio.run)
#     # is correctly in place, the test should work.

#     # The previous response provided the full test file with the fixture.
#     # The failure indicates that fixture is not fully effective.

#     # One more thing to try with the patch_asyncio_run_for_click_runner fixture:
#     # Ensure the patch targets are absolutely correct for how click.testing.CliRunner
#     # invokes asyncio.run. Sometimes, click might use `anyio.run` if `anyio` is installed.
#     # However, the error "coroutine 'chat' was never awaited" points to click's own async handling.

#     # Let's ensure the AsyncMocks are correctly awaited by the SUT.
#     # The `setup_cli_session_auth` awaits `api_client.login`.
#     # The `_run_chat_logic` awaits `api.chat` and `api.close`.
#     # The `AsyncMock` setup for these seems correct.

#     # The problem is almost certainly how CliRunner.invoke interacts with the pytest-asyncio event loop
#     # and how it tries to run the async 'chat' command.

#     # If the comprehensive patching of asyncio.run in the fixture isn't working,
#     # it might be that CliRunner is not using the global asyncio.run but one it has
#     # captured earlier or from a different context.

#     # Let's simplify the assertion for now to see if *any* output is produced.
#     # This helps isolate if the command body is running at all.
#     runner = CliRunner()
#     result = runner.invoke(cli, ["chat"], input="hello there\nexit\n")

#     print(f"Test Output: '{result.output}'")
#     print(f"Test Exception: {result.exception}")
#     if result.exc_info:
#         import traceback

#         traceback.print_exception(*result.exc_info)

#     assert result.exit_code == 0, (
#         f"CLI exited with code {result.exit_code}, output: '{result.output}', exception: {result.exception}"
#     )
#     # If the above passes, then the issue is with the content of the output.
#     # If it still fails with empty output, the async command execution is the core problem.

#     # Given the "coroutine 'chat' was never awaited" warning, the command body isn't running.
#     # The `patch_asyncio_run_for_click_runner` fixture is the key.
#     # Let's re-verify its implementation and application.
#     # The fixture provided in the previous full file content should be the one to use.
#     # The test function itself was mostly fine.

#     # The most common cause for this specific error with click async + pytest-asyncio + CliRunner
#     # is indeed the asyncio.run() conflict.

#     # Ensure the fixture `patch_asyncio_run_for_click_runner` is correctly defined as in the previous
#     # "full test file" response and is passed to this test function.
#     # If it is, and the problem persists, the patching targets might need to be even more specific
#     # or there's a deeper incompatibility with how CliRunner is trying to manage the async command.

#     # For now, the provided diff focuses on the assertions within the test, assuming the fixture
#     # `patch_asyncio_run_for_click_runner` is correctly implemented and applied.
#     # The previous "full file" response for tests/test_cli.py contained the most up-to-date fixture.
