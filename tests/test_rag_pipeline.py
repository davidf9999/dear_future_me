    # you might need to mock it where it's imported or ensure the DI override works as expected.
    # Example: from app.main import current_active_user (if that's its actual location)

    # Assuming current_active_user is a dependency that can be overridden directly:
    # If current_active_user is not directly available for import here,
    # you might need to adjust how it's overridden or ensure your app structure allows it.
    # For now, assuming this override mechanism works with your DI setup:
    # from app.main import current_active_user # Adjust this import to the actual location of the dependency

    # If it's from `fastapi_users. fastapi_users.current_user(...)`, the override might need to target that.
    # For this example, I'll assume `app.main.current_active_user` or similar that the router uses.
    # client.app.dependency_overrides[current_active_user] = mock_current_active_user # Adjust 'current_active_user'

    # If the chat endpoint does not require authentication for DEMO_MODE=true (which seems to be the case from your README)
    # then the auth override might not be strictly necessary if your tests run in demo mode or if you mock settings.
    # Given DEMO_MODE=true in .env.example, it's possible auth isn't hit for /chat/text always.
    # However, the original test includes headers={"Authorization": "Bearer testtoken"},
    # implying auth is expected to be processed or bypassed.
