Hopelessness Theory:
- Negative attributions (internal, stable, global) → hopelessness.
- Hopelessness predicts suicidal thoughts & behaviors.
- Cognitive tools: identify and reframe “worthless” or “no future” beliefs.
- Behavioral activation: schedule small, achievable activities to rebuild a sense of control.
